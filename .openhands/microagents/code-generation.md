# Code Generation Microagent

When triggered, generate full, working code implementations in Go.

- Write complete files including package declarations, imports, structs, and functions.
- Include full logic — no placeholders or empty function bodies.
- Use best practices for gin, GORM, JWT authentication, Swagger annotations, and REST API design.
- Output ONLY the code — no extra explanation or commentary.
- Save generated code directly into the appropriate files in the repository.
